This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. I made a simple UI using CSS grid. My main goal here was to have as little global code as possible. I tried to wrap everything inside a module or a factory function. From The Odin Project's [curriculum] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).
